<p>The original box model behavior was eventually considered unintuitive, so a new CSS property called box-sizing was created. When you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width. Here is the same example as the previous page, but with box-sizing: border-box; on both elements:</p>
<div class="box1">.simple {<br>
    width: 500px;<br>
    margin: 20px auto;<br>
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
       -moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
            box-sizing: border-box;<br>
  } <br><br>
  
  .fancy {<br>
    width: 500px;<br>
    margin: 20px auto;<br>
    padding: 50px;<br>
    border: solid blue 10px;<br>
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
       -moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
            box-sizing: border-box;<br>
  }</div>
  <div class="box2">(div class="simple") <br>
    We're the same size now!</div>
    <div class="box2">(div class="fancy") <br>
        Hooray!</div>
<p>Since this is so much better, some authors want all elements on all their pages to always work this way. Such authors put the following CSS on their pages:</p>
    <div class="box1">* { <br>
        -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
           -moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
                box-sizing: border-box;<br>
      }</div>
      <p>This ensures that all elements are always sized in this more intuitive way.</p>
<p>Since box-sizing is pretty new, you should use the -webkit- and -moz- prefixes for now, as I have in these examples. This technique enables experimental features in specific browsers. Also, keep in mind that this one is IE8+.</p>
<br><p>In order to make more complex layouts, we need to discuss the position property. It has a bunch of possible values, and their names make no sense and are impossible to remember. Let's go through them one by one, but maybe you should bookmark this page too.</p>
<br>
<h2>static</h2>
<div class="box1">.static { <br>
    position: static;<br>
  }</div>
<div class="box2">(div class="static") <br>
    static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</div>
 <br>
 <h2>relative</h2>
 <div class="box1">.relative1 { <br>
    position: relative;<br>
  } <br>
  .relative2 {<br>
    position: relative;<br>
    top: -20px;<br>
    left: 20px;<br>
    background-color: white;<br>
    width: 500px;<br>
  }</div>
  <div style="position: relative;">relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</div>
  <div style="position: relative;
  top: -20px;
  left: 20px;
  background-color: white;
  width: 500px;">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</div>
 <br>
 <h2>absolute</h2>
 <p>absolute is the trickiest position value. absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. If an absolutely-positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and still moves along with page scrolling. Remember, a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static. <br>Here is a simple example:</p>
<div class="box1">.relative { <br>
    position: relative;<br>
    width: 600px;<br>
    height: 400px;<br>
  } <br>
  .absolute {<br>
    position: absolute;<br>
    top: 120px;<br>
    right: 0;<br>
    width: 300px;<br>
    height: 200px;<br>
  }</div>
  <div style="position: relative;
  width: 600px;
  height: 400px;
  border: solid;"
  >This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
  <div style="position: absolute;
  top: 120px;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  border: solid;">This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent</div></div>
